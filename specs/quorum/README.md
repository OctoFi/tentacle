# Ethereum Main Net <-> Quorum Blockchain Data Transfers

This is a living document and will be updated continuously throughout the current development cycle.

## Main Features

- Allow Quorum blockchains to receive pushed data from the Ethereum mainnet (Node application updater, similar to the current stock/etf oracle but with lower latency, updated every blockch within 1-2 seconds)

- Allow Mainnet dApps to receive data from Quroum chains using node addresses in an asynchronous fashion using Eth or tokens as payment for each transaction. Also receive data synchronously but with lower latency due to gas fees, simil;ar to the stock/etf oracle node updater in this repo.
